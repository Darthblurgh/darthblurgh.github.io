### 3. Introducing Functions: Getting Functional
   - This chapter introduces the concept of functions in JavaScript and their role in code organization and reusability. It covers the mechanics of functions, function invocation, and the use of parameters and return values.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Example of a function that calculates the area of a rectangle
function calculateArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}

// Calling the function and storing the result in a variable
let area = calculateArea(5, 3);
console.log(area); // Output: 15
```

### 5. Understanding Objects: A Trip to Objectville
   - This chapter focuses on the transition from using primitives and arrays to working with objects in JavaScript. It covers the principles of object-oriented programming, creating custom objects, and understanding object properties and methods.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Example of creating a custom object
let person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    return 'Hello, my name is ' + this.name + ' and I am ' + this.age + ' years old.';
  }
};

// Accessing object properties and calling a method
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
console.log(person.greet()); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

### 6. Interacting with the DOM: Getting to Know the DOM
   - This chapter covers accessing and modifying the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. It includes topics such as event handling, dynamic web page interaction, and manipulating DOM elements.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Example of changing the text content of an HTML element
// HTML: <p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>
document.getElementById("demo").textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";
```

### 8. Building an App: Bringing It All Together
   - This chapter focuses on integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a complete web application. It covers creating the page structure with HTML, styling the application with CSS, and writing JavaScript code to implement the application's behavior.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Example of adding an event listener to a button
let button = document.getElementById("myButton");
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log("Button clicked");
});
```

### 9. Handling Events: Asynchronous Coding
   - This chapter introduces asynchronous programming in JavaScript, emphasizing the importance of writing code that reacts to events. It covers event handling, working with timers, and processing asynchronous data.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Example of setting a timeout to execute a function after a delay
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Delayed function executed");
}, 2000); // Output after 2 seconds: Delayed function executed
```
